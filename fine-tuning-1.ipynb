In India, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) 304A deals with the punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The main difference between the two is that murder is a more serious offence and is punishable with the death penalty or imprisonment for life. Culpable homicide, on the other hand, is punishable with imprisonment for a specified term.\n",

      "🟡 Base Model:\n",
      "The 'basic structure doctrine' is a judicial concept in India which holds that certain fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution are so fundamental that they cannot be altered or amended by Parliament. The doctrine was established by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Keshavananda Bharati v State of Kerala (1973). According to this doctrine, the Constitution can be amended only by a two-thirds majority vote in both Houses of Parliament, but certain provisions cannot be altered without the explicit consent of the people. This concept is based on the idea that the Constitution is a living document and that its provisions should evolve over time to reflect the changing values and aspirations of the people of India. The basic structure doctrine ensures that the fundamental rights and principles enshrined in the Constitution are protected and that the rule of law is upheld. It also ensures that the power of the State is limited and that the rights of the citizens are protected. The doctrine has been invoked by the Supreme Court in several cases to uphold the\n",

According to this doctrine, certain principles of the Constitution, such as the protection of individual rights, the promotion of social justice, and the protection of the environment, cannot be altered or amended by the legislature. These principles are considered to be inherent and essential to the Constitution and are therefore beyond the power of amendment. The basic structure doctrine serves as a safeguard against the erosion of fundamental rights and promotes the stability and integrity of the Constitution. It has been applied in several subsequent cases to ensure that the Constitution remains a living document that can adapt to changing societal needs while maintaining its core principles. The basic structure doctrine has been instrumental in protecting the rights of marginalized groups and ensuring that the Constitution remains a powerful instrument for social change and justice.
